2. REPORT DETAILS

DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP design_2_i/QCS_0/inst/ input pin design_2_i/QCS_0/inst//B[11] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#2 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP design_2_i/QCS_0/inst/ input pin design_2_i/QCS_0/inst//B[5] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_2_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_2_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_2_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.force_stop_cmd_rst_i_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_2_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.force_stop_TClk_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_2_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.normal_stop_cmd_rst_i_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_2_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Area.Core/Implement_Debug_Logic.Master_Core.Debug_Area/Serial_Dbg_Intf.normal_stop_TClk_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
