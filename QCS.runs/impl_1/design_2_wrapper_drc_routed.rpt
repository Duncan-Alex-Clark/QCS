PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A1' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1/I0) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O5=(A2*A3)+(A2*(~A3)*(~A4))+((~A2))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue.

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_2_i/QCS_0/inst/rpmlut_data_reg_0 has an input control pin design_2_i/QCS_0/inst/rpmlut_data_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: design_2_i/QCS_0/inst/ADDR[9]) which is driven by a register (design_2_i/QCS_0/inst/rpmlut_addr_reg_rep[9]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
